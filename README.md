# flickr-cast
Cast flickr photo albums to a chromecast.

Needs some form of server, so a Raspberry PI zero? But if possible without a server, that would be ideal, just having some static html/js/css and feed it your user ID and photo Album (set) ID.

Start with the web app, figuring out Chromecast dev and Flickr API
